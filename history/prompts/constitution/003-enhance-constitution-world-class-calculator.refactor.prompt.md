## Prompt

enhance the constitution more also add new features if needed bcz we have to creaete a worldclass calculator

## Response snapshot

I've reviewed the existing constitution.md. To elevate the project to a "world-class calculator," I'll enhance its principles. I'll introduce advanced features like a modern UI, scientific functions, and accessibility, while establishing a foundation for a professional-grade application.

## Outcome

- ✅ Impact: The project constitution was significantly enhanced to guide the development of a "world-class" calculator, not just a simple one. This sets a new vision and technical direction for the project.
- 🧪 Tests: No tests were run as this was a documentation change.
- 📁 Files: Modified 1 file: .specify/memory/constitution.md.
- 🔁 Next prompts: Implement the new principles, starting with a new feature.
- 🧠 Reflection: The constitution is now much more ambitious. The next steps should focus on implementing the newly defined architectural principles, such as choosing a UI framework via an ADR.

## Evaluation notes (flywheel)

- Failure modes observed: None
- Graders run and results (PASS/FAIL): N/A
- Prompt variant (if applicable): null
- Next experiment (smallest change to try): Propose an ADR for the UI framework.
